# Startup_Profit_Analysis

Welcome to the **Startup_Profit_Analysis** repository! This project leverages Machine Learning, particularly Linear Regression, to analyze and predict the profits of startups based on their R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. We employ various tools and libraries such as Scikit-Learn for model selection and evaluation, and pandas for data manipulation and analysis. 

Our dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` to ensure that our model generalizes well to unseen data. The repository includes a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that guides you through the entire process, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

By exploring this project, you will gain insights into the practical application of Linear Regression in business analytics, understand the nuances of feature selection and model evaluation with Scikit-Learn, and enhance your data handling skills using pandas. We encourage you to dive into the code, experiment with the data, and contribute to improving the model and expanding the analysis. Thank you for your interest and contributions to this project.
